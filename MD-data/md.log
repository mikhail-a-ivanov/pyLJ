Molecular dynamics of a Lennard-Jones fluid code 
Written as my first programming project for the 'Simulation Methods in Statistical Physics' course

Warning! The code does its job, but is extremely inefficient and naive
All the critical expressions for computations are borrowed either from the lectures or the Rahman (1964) paper
